# F1Tenth project 2021-22

Academic project at Ecole Polytechnique, 2021-22.

I am leading my team of 6 students to prepare the 2022 international autonomous racing competition of Milan. We are using ROS to implement reactive and map-based algorithms, and plan to try reinforcement learning techniques using PyTorch and OpenAI Gym in the coming months.

## Labs

Using the F1Tenth Labs, we learned existing algorithms to tackle this problem, including automatic emergency braking, wall following, reactive methods and map-based approaches.

See the Labs folder for code and demonstrations.

## Learning

We used machine learning techniques to drive our F1Tenth. See the Learning folder for details.
