# F1Tenth project 2021-22

Academic project at Ecole Polytechnique, 2021-22. 

I am leading my team of 6 students to prepare the 2022 international autonomous racing competition of Milan. We are using ROS to implement reactive and map-based algorithms, and plan to try reinforcement learning techniques using PyTorch and OpenAI Gym in the coming months. 

## Labs

We are working on the F1Tenth Labs to learn existing algorithms to tackle this problem, including automatic emergency braking, wall following, reactive methods and map-based approaches. 

See the Labs folder for code and demonstrations.

## Upcoming

In the coming months, we will continue our work on algorithmic solutions through the Labs, and try to apply reinforcement learning to the problem, using the PyTorch framework.
