# F1Tenth project 2021-22

Academic project at Ecole Polytechnique, 2021-22.

With my team of 6 students, we spend the academic year 2021-22 developing algorithms to drive an autonomous F1Tenth racecar. We used algorithmic techniques (follow the wall, follow the gap) and a supervised ML approach. We also tried to apply reinforcement learning using OpenAI Gym and stable baselines, but this technique was less successful. 

## Labs

Using the F1Tenth Labs, we learned existing algorithms to tackle this problem, including automatic emergency braking, wall following, reactive methods and map-based approaches.

See the Labs folder for code and demonstrations.

## Learning

We used machine learning techniques to drive our F1Tenth. See the Learning folder for details.
